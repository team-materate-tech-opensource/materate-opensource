I am making an graph using Networkx for all graph related query like finding neighbours adding nodes and edges etc.
Also, I am mainting an dictionary to store all the information related the nodes of the graph like skills and any other details if necessary.

Reason for using this approach:
    - Easy to maintain graph.
    - Easy to maintain nodes.
    - If we decide to make an tree out of graph then space usage will be minimum.
    - As the knowledge graph will be almost constant and will be updated rarely insertion, deletion, and edit can be O(n) but traversal in the graph is what matters the most.
